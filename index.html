      <h2>My Most Recent Hole-In-One</h2>
      <p>On September 20th, I made my second ever Hole-In-One at Wheatfield Valley Golf Club in Ingham County, Michigan.
        I was playing in a golf outing for the company I work for and we arrived onto the second hole of the day. It was about 143 yards, I pulled out my 9-iron and hit one of the best shots of my life. The ball took one bounce about 10 feet away and just sunk into the hole.
