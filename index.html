      <h2>My Most Recent Hole-In-One</h2>
      <p> On September 20th, I made my second ever Hole-In-One at Wheatfield Valley Golf Club in Ingham County, Michigan. I was playing in a golf outing for the company I work for, and we arrived onto the second hole of the day. It was about 143 yards, I pulled out my 9-iron and hit one of the best shots of my life. The ball took one bounce about 10 feet away and just sunk into the hole. My coworkers were in disbelief, and I was in shock myself, but I knew it went in. However, my boss was convinced that it bounced past the hole, so we had to go and see for ourselves. We drive up next to the green, one of my coworkers is filming me from behind as I am running up to the hole, I look down and I see my ball was indeed in the hole! We all started jumping up and down, celebrating and yelling to the groups around us. It was truly a special moment, and at 20 years old, I am proud to say that I have my second hole-in-one, now itâ€™s time to chase that feeling again.
