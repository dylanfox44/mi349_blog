      <p>Hello! I’m Dylan Fox, a student at Michigan State University in the first semester of my senior year, studying Information Science from Macomb, MI. Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I share my thoughts, experiences, and adventures.
        I’ve always had a love for technology and trying new things. Whether it's building computers, designing websites, or reading up on the latest technology in society.  
        My journey began when I got my first tech support job right out of high school, where I got to see a lot of different avenues of the Information Technology world. Since then, I’ve enjoyed my time at MSU studying Information Science with a focus of media and Information, as well as working another tech support job at a large insurance company. 
        When I'm not studying for my classes or working, you can find me working out, watching sports, hanging out with friends, golfing or traveling!  I love connecting with others who share my interests, so feel free to reach out!
